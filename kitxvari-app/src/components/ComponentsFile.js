                You watch ‚ÄúWhat? Where? When?‚Äù Yeah. Our founders used to play it.
                That‚Äôs where they got a question about a famous American author and
                screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the
                exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at that moment, a name
                for a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry üòá

                As we said, Redberry has been on the field for quite some time now,
                and we have touched and embraced a variety of programming languages,
                technologies, philosophies, and frameworks. We are battle-tested in
                PHP Laravel Stack with Vue.js, refined in React, and allies with Serverside
                technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and now we have set foot in the web3 industry.

                We were soo much fun before the pandemic started!
                Parties almost every weekend and lavish employee
                birthday celebrations! Unfortunately, covid ruined
                that fun like it did almost everything else in the world.
                But we try our best to zhuzh it up a bit. For example,
                we host biweekly Devtalks where our senior and lead developers
                talk about topics they are passionate about. Previous topics
                have included Web3, NFT, Laravel 9, Kubernetes, etc. We hold
                these talks in the office but you can join our Zoom broadcast
                as well. Feel free to join either as an attendee or a speaker!
